/* ============================================================
   chat-knowledge.js — WEBRO AI assistant brain data.

   This is the "training data". It does NOT use a neural model — it
   recognises THOUSANDS of customer phrasings by matching keywords +
   synonyms against a curated set of intents. Edit the data here to
   teach the bot new answers; the engine lives in chatbot.js.

   Sections:
     BUSINESS  — facts the bot speaks from (prices, services, etc.)
     SYNONYMS  — word groups so many phrasings map to one meaning
     SMALLTALK — greetings, thanks, identity, etc.
     OBJECTIONS— price/trust/"thinking about it" handling (sales)
     INTENTS   — ~80 topics, each matching dozens of questions
